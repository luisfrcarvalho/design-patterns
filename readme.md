# Design Patterns

* These repository follows the 24 Design Patterns stated by Gang Of Four. These patterns are divided in the following categories:
    - **Creational**: Different ways to create objects;
    - **Structural**: The relationship between objects;
    - **Behavioral**: Interaction between objects;


## Essentials - OOP features

### Encapsulation

- Bundling the data, and methods that operate on the data within one unit or class, hiding the values or state of an object inside the class.
- Following this principle we can create robust applications, preventing our objects from going to an invalid state.

### Abstraction

- The abstraction principle says we should hie unnecessary details in our classes. And this helps us reduce complexity.
- The object only exposes relevant data.

### Inheritance

- Mechanism for reusing code.
- The process by which one class acquires the properties and the functionalities of another class.

### Polymorphism

- Polymorphism means many forms. Ability of an object to take on many forms. (For example: using abstract methods and classes)
